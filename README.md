# 😇 Find a Friend - The Ultimate LDS Buddy System

Welcome to **Find a Friend**! 🎉 The app designed to help you find fellow Latter-day Saints faster than you can say, *"Do you want to swap casseroles?"* 🥘

## ✨ Why This App Exists  
Let’s face it—finding friends at church can be *hard*. One minute you’re sitting alone in sacrament meeting, the next, you’re contemplating whether or not to join the choir just for human interaction. But fear not! **Find a Friend** is here to match you with like-minded members near you. Think *LinkedIn meets Sunday School*, but with fewer business pitches and more potluck invitations.  

## 📜 Features  
✅ **Gospel-Centered Friend Matching** – Swipe right on potential friends who share your love for **Come, Follow Me** study sessions.  
✅ **Ward & Stake Locator** – Never awkwardly show up to the wrong ward potluck again.  
✅ **"Pioneer Trek" Mode** – Connect with other adventurous souls who love camping, hiking, and reenacting 19th-century hardships for fun.  
✅ **Home Evening Groups** – Because planning FHE shouldn’t feel like organizing a wedding.  
✅ **Fast Offering Tracker** – Remember who owes who lunch. Fair is fair.  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. **Download the App** (No, it's not in the Doctrine & Covenants, but it *should* be.)  
2. **Create a Profile** – Add your name, interests, and whether or not you bring **store-bought brownies** to ward activities (we won’t judge).  
3. **Swipe, Chat, and Connect** – Finally, a place where “Hi, my name is Elder…” isn’t your only icebreaker.  

## 🎭 Who Is This For?  
- Singles looking for **platonic** friendship without that awkward *"So… are we dating now?"* moment.  
- Newly moved members trying to crack the mystery of **which ward they actually belong to**.  
- Return missionaries who need **someone to practice their Spanish with**.  
- Anyone tired of **awkwardly eating alone** at Café Rio.  

## 🎩 Premium Membership?  
Nope! This app is as free as a **potluck with leftover funeral potatoes**.  

## 🙏 Future Features  
🗣️ **Missionary Companion Finder** – Because you never really knew what happened to Elder Johnson.  
📅 **Sunday School Escape Plan** – Auto-generates plausible excuses when class gets *too* deep.  
🎵 **Ward Choir Simulator** – Test your skills without embarrassing yourself in real life.
